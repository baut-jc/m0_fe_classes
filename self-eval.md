# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
* It was so challenging that it was starting to get upsetting. The time and the anxiety of being in the last day of mod0 are likely the biggest factor that added to this challenge. I realized that I have a lot to learn and I'm excited to explore this new language. Time to study up for Mod1!
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
* This particular challenge made me reflect on my workflow more, as I anticipate the load that I could face during Mod1
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
* Study up! Review! Review! Revisit! Practice! Communicate! Apply practices and plan for strategies!!
